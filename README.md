This project is to use matlab to model the spread of 3 diseases: seasonal-influenza, covid-19, and measles. The modeling model used is the SIR model which represents S(susceptible indivduals, I(infected indivduals), and lastly R(recovered individuals). To model the 3
diseases we're using 4th-order Runge-Kutta, least squares, and fourier analysis.
