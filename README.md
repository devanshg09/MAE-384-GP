# SIR Disease Modeling Project
This project uses MATLAB to model the spread of three infectious diseases: Seasonal influenza, COVID-19, and measles. The SIR model represents susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals. The modeling involves solving the SIR equations numerically with the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method, using the Newton method for interpolation to compare modeled and interpolated data, estimating parameters such as the transmission rate (Î²) and the initial infected population (I(0)) using manually implemented least squares fitting, and performing Fourier analysis to study the impact of periodic variations in transmission rates. The project demonstrates how numerical methods can predict epidemic trends and support public health decision-making.
